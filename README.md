# Predict_Loan_Default
<br>
In the financial sector, loan default prediction is a key task to minimize risk and ensure a healthy lending system. When a borrower fails to repay a loan, it leads to financial loss for lending institutions. Predicting loan defaults using machine learning helps in proactive risk assessment. <br>
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan based on their financial history, credit score, and other relevant socio-economic attributes. <br>
